  <article>This was my grandmother's apple pie recipe. I have never seen another one <br> quite like it. It will always
    be my favorite and has won me several first place <br> prizes in local competitions. I hope it becomes one of your
    favorites as well!

<h2>Directions</h2>
<p>1) Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Melt the butter in a saucepan. Stir in <br> flour to form a paste. Add water, white sugar and brown sugar, and bring
  to a boil. Reduce <br> temperature and let simmer. <br> 2) Place the bottom crust in your pan. Fill with apples, mounded
  slightly. Cover with a <br> lattice work crust. Gently pour the sugar and butter liquid over the crust. Pour slowly so <br>
  that it does not run off. <br> 3) Bake 15 minutes in the preheated oven. Reduce the temperature to 350 degrees F (175 <br>
  degrees C). Continue baking for 35 to 45 minutes, until apples are soft.</p>
